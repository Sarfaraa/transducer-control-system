# transducer-control-system
Designed a embedded system for transducer to control 0.1 degree tilt position underwater
Used lenardo controller which has multiple ADC channels to control different position of transducer
Sick tilt and pressure level sensor to achieve vertical and horizontal critical angle which is 0.1 degree
use analog to digital converters to convert sensors signal to understand controller
accumalte the calibration of sensor via note every initial reading and adjust surface and then used re refernced terminal to again organized the sensors to its origion position to get proper values according to requirement.
